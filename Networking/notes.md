Binary conversion is essential to understand in order to properly manage computer networks. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits split up into four sections of eight bits

The address 192.168.1.12 translates to:

		`11000000 10101000 00000001 00001100`

When considering individual bit values, we can break down each octet further. To break down the second octet valuing 168:

Decimal | Binary
------------ | -------------
128 | 1
64 | 0
32 | 1
16 | 0
8 | 1
4 | 0
2 | 0
1 | 0
